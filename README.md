Introduction
This Java console application demonstrates the use of a graph data structure to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted, undirected graph.  It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient pathfinding.

Functionality
The application takes a graph represented as an adjacency matrix (you can modify it to use an adjacency list). The user (implicitly, through the hardcoded graph and nodes) specifies a source and destination node. The application then calculates and displays:
The shortest path between the source and destination nodes.
The total weight (distance) of the shortest path.

Purpose and Contribution
This application serves as a practical demonstration of graph algorithms and data structures in Java.  It helps reinforce understanding of graph traversal and pathfinding techniques.  While a simple example, it can be expanded upon to create more complex applications such as:
Navigation systems: Finding the shortest route between locations on a map.
Social network analysis: Determining the shortest connection between two people in a social network.
Network routing: Optimizing data packet routing in computer networks.
